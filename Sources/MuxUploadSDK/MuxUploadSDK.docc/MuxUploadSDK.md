# ``MuxUploadSDK``

Allow your users to upload content directly to Mux from iOS or iPadOS.

## Overview

Use the Swift Upload SDK along with Direct Uploads to upload content directly to Mux without needing any intermediary steps using an authenticated URL.

You still get to control who gets an authenticated URL, how long it's viable, and, of course, the Asset settings used when the upload is complete.

Using Direct Uploads your application can upload content directly to Mux without needing any intermediary steps using an authenticated URL.

You still get to control who gets an authenticated URL, how long it's viable, and, of course, the Asset settings used when the upload is complete.
